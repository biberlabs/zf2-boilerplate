# Localization
ZF2 Boilerplate ships with a ready-to-use **Translator Service** to easily create multi-lingual applications. A custom translator factory creates a properly configured `translator` service instance and performs few additinal tasks to see translated validation messages which provided by ZF2. Factory located at `Core\Service\Factory\TranslatorServiceFactory`, you can check out or customize it by your requirements.

## Multi-Language application
You can create additonal language files which are necessary for your app under the [languages](/module/Core/language) folder. Following same convention will be enough. Current language is english (`en`) and fallback language is english (`en`) too by default. If you wish to change the default langauge, modify `translator` > `locale` config key in `Core` > `config` > `module.config.php`

## Usage of the Translator service
In your controllers, grab the `translator` service instance via serviceLocator and use it:

```php
$translator->getServiceLocator()->get('translator');
$translatedMessage = $translator->translate('Message to translate');
```

Or in your views / view helpers, just use the [translate view helper](http://framework.zend.com/manual/current/en/modules/zend.i18n.view.helpers.html#translate-helper)

```php
// Example filename: bar.phtml
<h1><?php echo $this->translate('Message to translate') ?></h1>
```
